  abstract = 	 {We consider linear dynamical systems, particularly
                coupled linear oscillators, where the parameters
                represent meaningful values in a domain theory and thus
                learning what affects them contributes to explanation.
                Rather than allow perturbations of latent states, we
                assume that temporal variation beyond noise is explained
                by parameter drift, and variation across coupled systems
                is a function of moderating variables. This change of
                focus reduces opportunities for efficient inference, and
                we propose sampling procedures to learn and fit the
                models. We test our approach on a real dataset of
                physiological measures of heterosexual couples engaged
                in a conversation about a potentially emotional topic,
                with body mass index (BMI) being considered as a
                moderator. We evaluate several models on their ability
                to predict future conversation dynamics (the last 20\%
                of the data for each test couple), with
                shared parameters being learned using held out data. As
                proof of concept, we validate the hypothesis that BMI
                affects the conversation dynamic in the experimentally
                chosen topic.}
