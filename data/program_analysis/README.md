### `crop_yield.f`

Original toy example created by Jon Stevens and Saumya Debray, used for the PA seedling kickoff (20180726)

The subdirectories `pa_crop_yield_v0.1` and `pa_crop_yield_v0.2` contain intermediate representations of analysis of the `crop_yield.f` source used during development of the functionality leading up to the kickoff.  These can likely be removed pending review.

### `joshua_toy_example`

Joshua Elliot's 1000 line "toy" example system.

### `pa_unit_tests`

Largely contains working notes for eventual program analysis unit tests, one unit test per program idiom.
